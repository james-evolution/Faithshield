                                    really what you want to do?</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">Please, don't do this. Instead.. <span class="tip-glow">Be with family. Give
                                        attention to your pets.
                                        Watch a movie. Play a game.
                                        Anything but this. Ask God to show you the way out. Get away from technology.</span>

                                    your reasons why.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">Every temptation is an opportunity to do good. Much is promised to those who
                                    resist temptation. A few seconds of fake pleasure is not worth more than the blessings
                                    you would otherwise receive. Sin is deceitful. Its pleasure lasts for but a moment, then
                                    the hole is filled with regret. God's blessings bring true joy. Joy that lasts.</p>

                                        receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love
                                        him."</span>

                                        is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will
