                                    disappointment, depression.</p>

                                    who
                                    resist. A few seconds of fake pleasure is not worth more than the
                                    blessings
                                    you would otherwise receive. Sin is deceitful. Its pleasure lasts for but a moment,
                                    then
                                    the hole is filled with regret. God's blessings bring true joy, and that joy lasts.</p>
